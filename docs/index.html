<H2>Overview</H2>
<!-- image -->
This API provides multiple secure connections between a smartphone
browser and an IoT device.
<h3>Properties:</h3>
<ul>
<li>End-to-end encrypted</li>
<li>Low running cost</li>
<li>Network agnostic</li>
<li>Simple,user friendly pairing</li>
<li>Multiple independent channels</li>
</ul>
<h3>Goal</h3>
Our goal is to
provide a easy web-developer friendly way to access data and services 
on an IoT device, without compromising the user's security

<h3>Differences from VPN</h3>
Conceptually it can be thought of as a point-to-point VPN, however 
the connections terminate <em>inside</em> the user's browser so 
are only available to that page - not to other apps on the same device.

<h3>Web API</h3>
<p><em>NOTE: This API is in Beta- the names and functionality may change. Specifically we expect to replace the Ipse name with Pipe before launch</em></p>
Each service offered by the IoT device is exposed with a websocket-like interface that will be familiar to web-developers. Each service is accessed by name e.g.:
<pre>
        var camChannel = pipe.createDataChannel("camera", {});
</pre>
Once opened a channel can be used:
<pre>
        camChannel.onopen = function() {
            camChannel.send(JSON.stringify({command: "read"}));
        };
</pre>
The semantics of each channel depend on it's purpose. See "Supported Services" for more details

<h3>Device Agent</h3>
The Device Agent runs on the IoT device. It consists of a multi-threaded networking process with some optional scripts to customize the services. 
<br/>
In our prototype devices it is run in the user's .xsession to ensure it is always present and has access to the screen. 

<h3>Pairing</h3>
When the device is freshly unboxed (or in the factory reset state), it has no local or remote keys. 
<br/>
On startup the Device agent will create a local (selfsigned) Public/Private keypair and put it into a keystore <pre>ipsecert.ks</pre> in the current directory.
<br/>
It then presents a token (derived from it's public key) for pairing.
Currently this is done visually as a QRcode - but it can also be done over a short range radio such as Bluetooth LE.
<br/> 
The new owner (aka <i>Master</i>) uses the <pre>claim.html</pre> page to scan the QRCode and thereby validating their proximity to (hence implied ownership of)  the new device.
<br/>
The |pipe| system facilitates a secure key-exchange between the device and the user's browser. Each side then stores the other's public key and it's fingerprint for future use.
<br/>
Any subsequent incomming connection requests to the device are ignored unless they use the Master's public key. Connections that pass this test can then access the device's services .

<h3>Web Service</h3>
The |pipe| system leverages WebRTC functionality in the browsers, this functionality is only available to 'secure' sites, so the claim.html and other pages must be hosted on an https:// site. (or localhost: for testing)
<br/>

We do not require any dynamic content on the site, so the pages can be hosted by any webservice - including github-pages or even jsfiddle.
<br/>

When pairing,
the Device stores the public key and identity in the keystore, but the webbrowser uses IndexDB. Access to IndexDb is restricted to pages from the 'same origin'. This means that the same site must be used to host
both claim.html and any other pages that access the device.

 
<h3>Connecting to a device</h3>
The following steps are needed to connect to a device:
<ol>
<li>Determine (or allocate) your own pipe-id:
<pre>
        Ipseorama.whoAmI(gotId, function(err) {
            console.log("could not create identity " + err);
        });
</pre>
</li>
<li>Connect to the Rendevous service
<pre>
       function gotId(id){
            pipe = new IpseDataChannel(id);
            pipe.getWs.onopen = function() {
              chooseDevice();
            }
       }
</pre>
</li>
<li>retreive the known device pipe-ids
<pre>
      function chooseDevice(){
            Ipseorama.dbListPrint(makeDc);
      }      
</pre>
</li>
<li>Select a device and connect to a service on it
<pre>
    function makeDc(friends) {
        pipe.setNonce("");
        pipe.setTo(friends[friends.length -1].finger);
        camChannel = pipe.createDataChannel("camera", {});
        camChannel.onopen = function() {
            camChannel.send(JSON.stringify({command: "read"}));
        };
        camChannel.onmessage = onDcMessage;
    }
</pre>
</li>
</ol>



<h3>Network topologies</h3>
The |pipe| system uses ICE (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc5245/">RFC 5245</a>) to provide efficient and secure NAT traversal. Both the device and the browser (smartphone) can be behind different routers and still achive direct communication. In some cases this isn't possible and a |pipe| supplied TURN server will be used. The TURN server has no access to the content of the messages.<br/>
These features are a standard part of the Chrome, Firefox and Edge browsers.
<br/>
In order to facilitate pairing and subsequent connections a |pipe| provided rendevous server is used. Devices and Browsers make websocket connections to this service to exchange setup messages.

<h3>Supported Services</h3>
The following services are supported in the prototype device agent:

<h3>Factory Reset</h3>
Removing the file ipsecert.ks will remove all the pairing information from the device.
When restarted it will show a QRcode again.

This does not remove the corresponding entries in the user's smartphone, use:
<pre>
            Ipseorama.dbDelPrint(tofinger, dcb);
</pre>
to do that. (see delete.html)

<h3>Device requirements</h3>
We currently require at minimum :
<ul>
<li>Linux</li>
<li>64Mb RAM</li>
<li>400Mhz</li>
<li>Java 8 SE - this can be either Oracle's java or OpenJDK</li>
<li>30Mb Flash</li>
<li>A screen 64x64 pixel</li>
OR
<li>Bluetooth LE (comming soon)</li>
</ul>
We have tested on many small linux devices, we reccomend the Raspberry Pi 3 as a good starting point.

The Device agent can also be run on a Mac or Windows machine, but many of the Services are not supported.

<h3>Smartphone requirements</h3>
We currently only support Android 5.X and higher - Chrome on Mac or Windows can also be used for testing,
provided a good webcam is available.
